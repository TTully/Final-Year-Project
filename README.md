# Final-Year-Project
Final Year Home Security Project 

This project/Repository contains the code for my Android App, Webserver, Webpages etc
This project uses a variety of different coding languages like java, python, javascript and html.

The android App allows the user to add there RTSP IP cameras to the app by entering the details into a database, by entering a name for the 
camera (e.g front of house) and the IP address. If the user is unable to find out the IP Address of the camera, there is a feature included
where you can scan the network at which your phone is on and it will display all the active IP Addresses, so once your phone and your IP 
Camera are on the same network it should find the ip address of the camera. The android app also uses the LibVLC library, developed by the 
VideoLan Organisation (https://www.videolan.org/)
